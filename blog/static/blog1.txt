Deploying a Django project involves several steps. Here's a general overview:  
1. Upload Your Code: The first step is to upload your Django project to your chosen hosting platform. 
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create a virtual environment and install Django along with any other dependencies your project requires. 
3. Configure Your Web App: This typically involves setting up your web app with your chosen hosting platform. You might need to configure the settings module, apply WSGI or ASGI middleware, and handle static files.
4. Choose a Web Server: Django, being a web framework, needs a web server to operate. Django currently supports two interfaces: WSGI and ASGI. 
5. Set Up a Production-Level Infrastructure: This includes setting up databases, application servers, and possibly a reverse proxy or load balancer. 
6. Run Deployment Checks: Django provides a deployment checklist that you should run through to ensure your configurations are suitable for production. Remember, the exact steps can vary based on your specific needs and the hosting service you choose. Some popular choices for deploying Django applications include Gunicorn with Nginx, uWSGI, Daphne, Hypercorn, Uvicorn, and cloud hosting services like PythonAnywhere.
